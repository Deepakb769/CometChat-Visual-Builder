CometChat Visual Builder Feedback

Overall Experience
I explored the process of building a chat application using CometChat’s Visual Builder, a low-code platform designed to streamline the integration of chat features into your app. The experience was smooth, beginner-friendly, and required minimal coding, thanks to CometChat’s intuitive interface and comprehensive documentation.

Key Steps and Highlights

1. Getting Started with Documentation: I began by referencing the official CometChat documentation, which clearly outlined the integration steps. The structured guidance helped me quickly grasp how to use the Visual Builder and what to expect during the process.

2. Visual Builder as a Pre-Assembled UI: CometChat offers the Visual Builder as the first integration option — an excellent way to create a fully functional, pre-assembled chat interface with minimal setup. It lets you drag-and-drop key UI elements without writing code, making it ideal for rapid development.

3. Feature Configuration Made Easy: One of the standout features is the ability to enable or disable specific components through toggles directly in the visual interface. This gives complete control over which elements appear in your app — like message lists, chat windows, user lists, etc. — without diving into the code.

4. Video Guide for Setup: To assist with setup, I followed the YouTube video tutorial linked in the documentation. The step-by-step video walkthrough was incredibly helpful and made the entire process very easy to understand, especially for developers new to chat integrations.

5. No Need for Custom Component Creation: The Visual Builder handles all the heavy lifting — there is no need to create additional custom components unless you want to extend or deeply customize your app. Simply configure the layout and features during setup, and you’re ready to go.

6. Download the UI Kit: After completing the configuration in the Visual Builder, you can download the ready-to-use UI Kit tailored to your setup. This kit includes all the necessary files and components to run the chat interface as configured.

7. Setting Up the Project Locally: I used Vite to scaffold a new React project. After naming the project and installing the required npm dependencies, the downloaded UI Kit integrated seamlessly. At this point, everything was set up and ready to run — no additional configuration needed.



Drawbacks and Areas for Improvement : 

1. Component Limitations: The components available are predefined and may not cover all use cases. If your app needs unique UI/UX patterns (like embedded games or third-party widget support), you’ll need to manually modify the exported code.

2. Dependency on Internet Connection: The Visual Builder is a web-based tool and requires a stable internet connection to function smoothly. Offline development or setup isn’t possible directly through it.

3. No Direct Backend Logic Integration: While it takes care of frontend setup, there’s no way to visually connect or configure backend logic (e.g., database hooks, custom API logic, etc.) within the builder itself.

4. Zoom Scroll Active in Default View: One minor UX issue is that zoom scroll (Ctrl + Scroll or trackpad pinch) is active even when the interface is already at 100% (default zoom). This can be distracting or cause unintentional zooming when navigating the layout or inspecting elements. A lock or limit on zoom behavior in the default view would enhance usability.

5. Limited Customization within Visual Builder: While the Visual Builder is great for quick setups, it lacks flexibility for more advanced customizations.
